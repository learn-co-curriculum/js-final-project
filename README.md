# JavaScript Final Project

Now that you've learn all about closures, callbacks, manipulating the DOM, and prototypical inheritance, it's time to build a JavaScript project of your very own!

## One Rule

Unless otherwise discussed with your instructor, this isn't the best time to learn a JS framework. The world of JavaScript is huge with many libraries and frameworks to choose from. They're great, but as a beginner, it isn't valuable to jump into a framework before you're comfortable with the language it's written in. Just like how you learn Ruby and Sinatra before Rails, you should be super comfortable with JavaScript on its own before learning a framework like Ember or Angular. 

## Ideas

* Think about iterating over your app from your Rails final project and incorporating JavaScript to it.
* If you built an API for your Rails final project, maybe you want to consume it with your own JS front-end.
* Build a super slick single page app that uses Ajax, jQuery, jQuery UI, etc. It can have a backend either from your Rails or Sinatra final project, or something new from scratch. You'll need to consult with an instructor first though; the focus should be on building with JS, not ruby for this.
* Using an external API for data and work with it on the front-end (talk to your instructor first about what you have in mind).
* Building a single-page, non-persisted, client-side app to solve a problem / make a tool for something in your life. Go to town on it: Ajax, jQuery, best practices, prototypes, test it with Jasmine if you have time too.

## Thoughts

Your project should be an exercise in reinforcing what you've learned with JavaScript, not necessarily about incorporating external libraries. It's kind of hard to get away with not using them (remember jQuery is a library!), but you'll have more time in Project Mode, with personal projects later on, and in your career to work with external libraries. Take this time to get really comfortable with all aspects of the language and to build things from scratch.
